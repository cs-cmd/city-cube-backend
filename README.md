# CityCube's Backend

This repository is all server-side code for the fictional [CityCube restaurant](https://github.com/cs-cmd/city-cube-v2). Requests to this server will be validated via an API key system provided to the caller.

The backend provides a menu, sign-in functionality, order placement, and account management.
